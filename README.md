# neuroworm

neuroworm is a small experimental Python project that simulates a simple “worm” agent with a minimal artificial brain.
The goal of the project is to explore basic agent behavior, decision-making logic, and potential future use of neural or rule-based systems.

## Features

+ Basic worm/agent implementation

+ Simple “brain” logic inside worm.py

+ Entry point in app.py

+ Clean and minimal project structure

+ Easy to extend with more complex behavior or an environment
